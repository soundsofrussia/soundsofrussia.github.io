Strouse was as bewildered and grief stricken as we all
were on Feb. 14 when 17 lives were violently lost at Marjory
Stoneman Douglas. Dr. Strouse, who studied music under
some of the most renowned musicians in Russia, played the
violin and was the conductor of the Kiev Youth Orchestra prior
to coming to the United States. Strouse is a music instructor in
Coral Springs and said that her ties to Parkland are strong as
some of her students are from that area.

Fortunately, none of her students were among the 17 but
Strouse said some of the students were so grief stricken
that they were unable to continue with their lessons. Strouse
said she continued to ask herself “What can I do?” With
preparations already underway for her December 2018 recital,
Strouse made the decision that she would alter the program to
honor the memory of the shooting victims.

A personal incident involving her husband, who has dementia,
further cemented this decision. According to Strouse, her
husband had an episode at their home and a call for help
was made. Strouse indicated that her husband was confused
and the incident with the authorities escalated. Her husband
became more afraid, paranoid, and resistant. What ensued
left Strouse in shock and disbelief. She describes the situation
where she said her husband was beaten.

Strouse discusses the lack of responsibility she feels the police
took in both the situation at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and
with her husband. “No one is bringing those children back
and my husband will never be the same. Music is my voice,”
Strouse said, and she knew that she must use music in her
words “as a warning to the innocent.”

During the recital, titled “In Honor of the 17 Lost,” some
wore orange, the color of awareness. Strouse teaches three
instruments: the violin, the piano, and viola. Some of the
students played all three instruments during the program that
took place at Mary Magdalene Episcopal Church on Dec.15, 2018. 
Strouse said the entire performance was done in minor
as a somber reminder. The final piece, titled Panis Angelicus,
was difficult to complete through the tears, Strouse adding
that “life is precious.”
