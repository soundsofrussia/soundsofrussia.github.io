When Coral Springs music teacher Dr. Leana Strouse entered 21 of  her piano and violin students to compete at the Florida Federation of Music Clubs, Inc. (FFMC) Annual Junior Convention in Jacksonville, she was confident they'd certainly do their best, but their actual results were truly amazing! Of the thousands of students who competed in the prestigious statewide contest, Dr. Strouse's students brought home 26 (no typo) TWENTY-SIX 1" and 2"d place prizes! Among winners were Parkland kids Alissa Babaian, age 12, Max Benaroch, 15, William Li, age 7 and Jessica Pan, 9.

This year's event marks the 71st annual FFMC Junior Convention, held at the University of N. Florida in Jacksonville on May 2-3. The kids from Dr. Strouse's studio are mostly residents of Coral Springs and Parkland and first were required to compete at the regional "Royal Poinciana" level in order to qualify to participate at the state contest in May. After months of practice, students first performed their music in February at Broward  Community College for panels of judges. Those who ranked "superior" were invited to the competition in  Jacksonville at the FFMC state event, where they repeated their performances for volunteer judges, who are musicians and music teachers from all over Florida. Way to go kids!
