The music students of Dr. Leana Strouse really gave her something to be proud
of this year. This past May, 19 of the Coral Springs teacher’s piano, violin and viola
students competed in the Florida Federation of Music Clubs, Inc. (FFMC) Annual
Junior Convention in Jacksonville. Competing against thousands of students
in the statewide contest, the kids, mostly from Coral Springs and Parkland,
brought home 36 fi rst prizes and honorable mentions! Among the winners
were Parkland residents Max Benaroch, Daniela Velez and Jessica Pan, who play
piano, Sarah Fishkin, who plays violin, and Alissa Babaian, who competed in
both violin and viola categories.

The competition this year is the 72nd annual Junior Convention for the FFMC. It
was held at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville on May 1-2. The local
music students fi rst were required to compete at the regional “Royal Poinciana”
level at Broward College last February. Only if they were judged with “superior”
in their category at the regional level were they invited to compete at the state
level in May.

The force behind so much musical success is their music teacher, Dr. Leana
Strouse, who moved here from Russia in 1997 and operates a thriving music
studio in her home. Dr. Strouse is thrilled by the overall performance
of her students saying, “My kids make me so proud. We had a great year at the festival.”
